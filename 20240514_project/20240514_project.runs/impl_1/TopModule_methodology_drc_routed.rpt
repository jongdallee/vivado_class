LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell upcounter/counter[13]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) upcounter/counter_reg[0]/CLR, upcounter/counter_reg[10]/CLR,
upcounter/counter_reg[11]/CLR, upcounter/counter_reg[12]/CLR,
upcounter/counter_reg[13]/CLR, upcounter/counter_reg[1]/CLR,
upcounter/counter_reg[2]/CLR, upcounter/counter_reg[3]/CLR,
upcounter/counter_reg[4]/CLR, upcounter/counter_reg[5]/CLR,
upcounter/counter_reg[6]/CLR, upcounter/counter_reg[7]/CLR,
upcounter/counter_reg[8]/CLR, upcounter/counter_reg[9]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
